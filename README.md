# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles/configs for various apps and tools. Please note, that they are constantly changing and can be a little out of date.

// `stow` is highly recommended in order to manage your dotfiles. For example to create a symlink for a module, such as nvim, you can run `stow nvim` and you are good to go.
